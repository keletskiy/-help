Several configuration options are available, the most notable include:
--with-demos
includes the demo applications and Drawstuff library.
--with-tests
includes the automated test suite, recommended if you intend to modify ODE.
--no-trimesh
excludes support for triangle mesh collision geometries, reducing the size of the library.
--with-gimpact
uses the GIMPACT library to check for triangle mesh collisions instead of OPCODE.
--with-libccd
uses libccd to handle pairs of geoms that don't have yet specialized tests.
Specify options before the toolset when running Premake, like so:
